# Frameshifter

Frameshifter is a grammar-based HTTP/2 fuzzer with mutation ability. This tool was developed for a research [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/jabiyev) (titled "FRAMESHIFTER : Security Implications of HTTP/2-to-HTTP/1 Conversion Anomalies") published at [USENIX Security 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/).

## Getting Started (using docker)

If you run the commands shown below in the given order, you will have a running container where the Frameshifter is installed and a file (i.e., `/tmp/output`) which contains a couple of mutated HTTP/2 inputs created by the tool. Please, note that the fourth and fifth commands are supposed to be run in the opened container shell.

1. `git clone https://github.com/bahruzjabiyev/frameshifter && cd frameshifter` (cloning the repo)

2. `docker build -t tool/frameshifter .` (building the tool image)

3. `docker run -ti tool/frameshifter bash` (running a container)

4. `source scapyenv/bin/activate` (switching to the virtual environment where the libraries are installed)

5. `seq 1 5 > /tmp/seeds; python3 /src/main.py -i -t -c /conf/simple_conf -f /tmp/seeds -o /tmp/output; jq '.' /tmp/output`

`seq 1 5 > /tmp/seeds; python3 /src/main.py -i -c /conf/simple_conf -f /tmp/seeds -o /tmp/output; jq '.' /tmp/output`

`seq 1 1 > /tmp/seeds; python3 /src/main.py -i -c /conf/simple_conf -f /tmp/seeds -v -o /tmp/output; jq '.' /tmp/output`

## About
A user-specified configuration file (see an example [here](conf/simple_conf)) tells Frameshifter how to generate and mutate HTTP/2 inputs and where to deliver them. To generate inputs, Frameshifter uses an input grammar (see `config.grammar` [here](conf/simple_conf)). Once the input is generated, a number (which is decided by the configuration) of mutations are applied. Mutations can be two types: content and sequence. The configuration decides (see `config.symbol_mutation_types`) what type of mutation can be applied on what input component. Both content and sequence mutations have their mutators defined in the configuration (see `config.string_mutators` and `config.tree_mutators`). Mutators which add or replace, uses a pool to pick the new element to add or to replace with (see `config.char_pool` and `config.char_pool`). Finally, the configuration also lists the target addresses.

## Example
Let's remember how we ran the tool and created `/tmp/output`.

`seq 1 5 > /tmp/seeds; python3 /src/main.py -i -t -c /conf/simple_conf -f /tmp/seeds -o /tmp/output; jq '.' /tmp/output`

First, `/tmp/seeds` file is created containing numbers from 1 to 5. This file is fed as an input to the tool with the `-f` option and the tool uses each of these numbers as a seed to create and mutate an input. The `-t` option put the tool in the testing mode and instructs the tool not to deliver the inputs. Finally, the `-o` option specifies where to save the inputs for us to look at. Let's start from the seed number 1 (i.e., `jq '.["seeds"]["1"]' /tmp/output`).

As shown below, three pieces of information is retained for each seed: 1) the generated input, 2) the mutations applied and 3) responses returned by the targets. In this example, we have a `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame inserted after the `HEADERS` frame and two character modifications of the `:method` header (i.e., `POST` becomes `]ST`). To see all the supported frame types, please take a look at [here](conf/experiment_conf).

## Testing
To run the tests, take the steps 1-4 given in the `Getting Started` section (see above). Then run the command below:

`cd /src/tests; python3 test_main.py`

## Limitations
The naming of symbols in the grammar needs to follow some rules which are listed below. To be safe from the naming issues, it is recommended to follow the examples of [here](conf/experiment_conf) which is extensive enough.

1. Symbols representing the frames should have a name starting with `<frame-type>-frame` (e.g., headers-frame).

2. The names of symbols which represent individual frame fields should end with specific words (e.g., `flags`, `stream_id`).

3. The names of symbols which represent header names and values should end with `header-name` and `header-value` respectively.
